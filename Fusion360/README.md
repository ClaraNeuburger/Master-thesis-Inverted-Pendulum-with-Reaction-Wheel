This folder contains all the pieces designed on Fusion3D software and 3D printed to create the inverted pendulum with reaction wheel prototype. 

The support structure serves as base to receive the microcontroller (Arduino) and driver (ESCON). They however have some dimensioning issue in terms of the holes to insert screws to secure the 2 parts.

On this support structure are placed 2 'base structure' shown bellow. One is designed with a hole on top to allow the cables to directly reach the top of the driver for connection.

Between those 2 bases are places ball bearings (add dimensions) as well as a rectangular holder in which the pendulum is placed and secured with screws.

On top of the pendulum is placed the upper structure meant to link with the motor and the inertial measurement unit.

 The reaction wheel is linked to the motor and holes are designed to add screws and nuts to increase its inertia.
