This folder contains all the pieces designed on Fusion3D software and 3D printed to create the inverted pendulum with reaction wheel prototype. 

The support structure serves as base to recieve the microcontroller and driver as well as the 2 'base structure', one with a cable holder to allow the cables to go firectly to the driver. Between those 2 bases are places ball bearings as well as a rectangular holder in which the pendulum is placed and secured with screws. 
On top of the pendulum is placed the upperstructure meant to link with the motor and the inertial measurement unit. The reaction wheel is linked to the motor and holes are designed to add screws and nuts to increase its inertia.
