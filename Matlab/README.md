This folder contains all the main Matlab codes and Simulink simulations used to define the pendulum parameters and establish the control laws. 

Codes 'Identification_TF.m', 'cost_TF.m' and 'verification.m' are used to identify and verify the transfer function of the motor (speed response to a current step input). 

The code 'model_verif.m' is used to superpose the experimental results to the simulation
