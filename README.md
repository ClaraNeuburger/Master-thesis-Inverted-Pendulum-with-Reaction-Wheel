# Inverted Pendulum Actuated by a Reaction Wheel

This github repository contains the codes (Arduino and Matlab) and CAD files used to create a 2D inverted pendulum actuated by a reaction wheel. 
It consists of a rigid pendulum rod placed on a surface which will be stabilized in the upright position using a motor coupled to a wheel placed on top of the pendulum.
