# Inverted Pendulum Actuated by a Reaction Wheel

This github repository contains the codes (Arduino and Matlab) and CAD files used to create a 2D inverted pendulum actuated by a reaction wheel. 
This project was carried out to support the teaching of control engineering at the SAAS (Service d’Automatique et d’Analyse des Systèmes) laboratory at ULB.

## Overview
It consists of a rigid pendulum rod placed on a surface which will be stabilized in the upright position using a motor coupled to a wheel placed on top of the pendulum as shown bellow.
